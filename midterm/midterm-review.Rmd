\section*{Midterm Policies}

You should have the following items on your desk (and nothing else) during the midterm:

- Pen and/or pencil and/or eraser - make sure you have enough writing utensils and they are functional. You should not try to open your bag to get another pen. Have everything ready prior to the midterm. 

- Scientific calculator. 

- UCI Student ID card - we will come around to check your ID during the midterm. 

The following items are __not__ permitted during the midterm

- Scrap paper
- Watches - remaining time will be displayed on the screen.
- Cell phones - turn your cell phone off completely and put it in your bag not in your pocket. 
- Laptops / Ipads/Tablets
- Graphing calculator
- Notes of any kind, books etc. 
- Any note taking device or any device with internet connectivity

Note that if you use an eraser (for pen or pencil) and do not erase well, you may not receive any points if previous answer and the latest answer are visible simultaneously.

Multiple choice questions have one correct answer. Only choose one of the choices. Write your answers in the boxes provided. You should only write a single letter in each of these boxes.

For questions that are __not__ multiple choice, show your work. Write your final answers in the boxes provided. You should only write numbers in these boxes. For instance if your answer is $P(A) = 0.12$ only write $0.12$ inside the box.

You will have 75 minutes. You may not leave the classroom if you finish early. Use the remaining time to review your answers. 

 

You may not start the midterm until you are prompted to start. Just write your name and student ID number and wait for the prompt to start.

The `avocado` data frame has information on avocado sales in 2017 as reported by the Hass Avocado Board. Answer the following three questions based on the output below. 

```{r echo = TRUE}

1. The variable `average-price` shows the average sale price of certain type of avocado on a given day. R has read `average-price` as a character variable. If you were to mutate `average_price` as a different type of variable that would reflect its statistical characteristics, in other words what type of variable would you mutate to?

6. In 2009 there was a large outbreak in the U.S. of a flu strain clinically known as H1N1, but commonly known as the Swine Flu since the strain was similar to one found in pigs. That year, 20% of the population contracted Swine Flu. A test was developed at the time to diagnose whether a patient had the disease or not. If we knew a patient had Swine Flu, there was a 98% probability that they would get a positive test result. If we knew a patient did not have Swine Flu, there was a 96% probability that they would get a negative test result.




a. What is the probability that a patient did not have Swine Flu and got a positive test result?

Because you have to split your time between the two experiments, and you don’t have time to re-do either, there is a 80% chance that you will perform your chemistry experiment correctly, a 52% chance you will perform you physics experiment correctly, and a 43% chance that you will perform both your physics experiment and your chemistry experiment correctly.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) is an immigration policy of the United States that provides a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and work permit to individuals who were brought to the United States as children and who do not have a lawful presence. Note that DACA policy does not grant citizenship but grants two-year residency and work permit. On September 5, 2017 President Trump made a decision to end the DACA program. University of California was the first university in the nation to file suit in federal court against this decision. The oral arguments of this case will begin on November 12th in the US Supreme Court.

For the following five questions we will be working with public opinion on DACA policy and the US-Mexico border wall. In June 2018 [Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/235775/americans-oppose-border-walls-favor-dealing-daca.aspx), an internationally well-known American analytics company, indicated that 

\begin{displayquote}


41\% favor expanding construction of walls along U.S.-Mexico border

83\% approve of allowing DACA immigrants to become citizens  

Republicans, Democrats agree on DACA, disagree on walls 

\end{displayquote}


Gallup also published some information about their survey methods as stated below:

\begin{displayquote}

Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted June 1-13, 2018, with a random sample of 1,520 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. 

Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 70\% cellphone respondents and 30\% landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods.
