\section*{Final Policies}

You should have the following items on your desk (and nothing else) during the final:

- Pen and/or pencil and/or eraser - make sure you have enough writing utensils and they are functional. You should not try to open your bag to get another pen. Have everything ready prior to the midterm. 

- Scientific calculator. 

- UCI Student ID card - we will come around to check your ID during the midterm. 

The following items are __not__ permitted during the midterm

- Scrap paper
- Watches - remaining time will be displayed on the screen.
- Cell phones - turn your cell phone off completely and put it in your bag not in your pocket. 
- Laptops / Ipads/Tablets
- Graphing calculator
- Notes of any kind, books etc. 
- Any note taking device or any device with internet connectivity

Note that if you use an eraser (for pen or pencil) and do not erase well, you may not receive any points if previous answer and the latest answer are visible simultaneously.

Multiple choice questions have one correct answer. Only choose one of the choices. Write your answers in the boxes provided. You should only write a single letter in each of these boxes.

For questions that are __not__ multiple choice, show your work. Write your final answers in the boxes provided. You should only write numbers in these boxes. For instance if your answer is $P(A) = 0.12$ only write $0.12$ inside the box. 

You will have 115 minutes. You may leave the classroom if you finish early. Make sure to review your answers before leaving.

You may not start the final until you are prompted to start. Just write your name and student ID number and wait for the prompt to start. Once you begin make sure to write your name and Student ID on top of every page.

\item Jared brings his Macbook into the Apple store because he feels it has not been working properly. The diagnostics test found that there is a problem with graphics chip and it gets sent to get repaired. Once it starts being repaired, it turns out that it was never actually broken. What type of error did the diagnostics test produce and why?

    \item A Type II error because we failed to reject the null hypothesis and it turned out the null was false. 
    \item A Type II error because we rejected the null hypothesis and it turned out the null was true.
    \item No error was committed.

You test the following hypotheses:

with a sample of n = 397, and obtain a T-statistic of 1.27. Answer the next three questions based on this information.

We have information on daily air quality measurements for New York between May and September 1973. We would like to know if there is a relationship between temperature (degrees F) and ozone (ppb). Below is a summary of the linear model regression temperature (variable is called `Temp`) on ozone (variable is called `Ozone`). Answer the next four questions based on this information.


```{r echo = FALSE}

data("airquality")

model1 <- lm(Temp ~ Ozone, data=airquality)

sum_model1 <- 
  model1 %>%
   summary()

sum_model1$call <- "lm(formula = ______________, data = airquality)"

print(sum_model1)
```

\item The model summary has a blank. Fill in the blank with appropriate code.

\item Interpret the coefficients (slope and intercept) in the context of air quality.

\item \label{itm:first} Below are a residual plot, a QQ-plot, and a histogram of residuals for the model. Check whether the conditions for a linear regression are met.

```{r echo = FALSE}
airquality <- airquality %>%
   add_predictions(model1) %>%
   add_residuals(model1)
