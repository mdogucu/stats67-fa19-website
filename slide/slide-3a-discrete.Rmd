## Random Variable

Capital letters $X, Y, Z$ is usually reserved to indicate random variables. 

Lower case letters $x, y, z$ are reserved to indicate observed _outcome_ of the random variables. 

e.g. $X$ is the number on a die after a roll.   
The possible outcomes of $X$ are $x \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$  
To indicate a specific outcome we use subscript such as $x_1$, $x_2$... or we 
use $x_i$ to refer to any outcome.
$P(X = 1) = \frac{1}{6}$

## Discrete Random Variables

A discrete random variable has a sample space that is finite or countably infinite. When we refer to discrete random variables, the event itself can be numeric (the die shows 6) or not (the playing card is red), the random variable can still be discrete. 

e.g. Let X be the random variable that correspons to a random coin tossing process


For the following decide if

                  mean1_sd3, 
                  mean1_sd1, 
                  mean3_sd3)
plot_type <- c(rep("A",1000),
               rep("B",1000),

               rep("D",1000))

## Mean and Variance with  R

For observed data we have already seen the summarize function which can be used to calculate mean, variance, and standard deviation.

```{r}
titanic_train %>% 
  summarize(mean(Fare), sd(Fare), 
            var(Fare))
```

We will learn about how we can calculate $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ for a given probability function.

## R as a calculator

```{r}
3 + 5
```

Note that output is a vector with a length of 1. R is one indexed.

## Object Assignment in R

```{r}
x <- 13
x
```
---

## Object Assignment in R

```{r}
y <- c(21, 8)
y
```

Note the [1] in the output the index number for 21

## Object Assignment in R

```{r}
test <- c("yes", "no", "no", "no")
test
```

## Object Assignment in R

Why is it the `<-` operator and not `=`?

## Unfair Die

In some games, getting a high roll on a die can be adventageous. To serve some advantage an unfair die has been created with the following properties:

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
f_x <- c(1/10, 1/10, 1/10, 1/10, 
         2/10, 2/10)
```

Is `f_x` a probability distribution? How do you know?

## Expected Value by hand

How would you calculate $E(X)$ if you were calculating by hand? You do not need to calculate it but think about the process.
---
## Expected Value in R

```{r}
mu <- sum(x*f_x)
mu
```
---

## Variance by hand

How would you calculate $Var(X)$ if you were calculating by hand? You do not need to calculate it but think about the process.
---
## Variance in R

```{r}
sigma2 <- sum((x-mu)^2*f_x)
sigma2 
```
---

## Standard Deviation in R

```{r}
sigma <- sqrt(sigma2)
sigma
```
