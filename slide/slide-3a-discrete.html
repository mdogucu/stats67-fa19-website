## Random Variable
Random variables are numeric values that are possible numeric outcomes of a random process. Capital letters `\(X, Y, Z\)` are usually used to indicate random variables. 

Lower case letters `\(x, y, z\)` are reserved to indicate __observed outcome__ of the random variables. 

e.g. `\(X\)` is the number on a die after a roll.   
The possible outcomes of `\(X\)` are `\(x \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\)`  
To indicate a specific outcome we use subscript such as `\(x_1\)`, `\(x_2\)`... or we 
use `\(x_i\)` to refer to any outcome.
`\(P(X = 1) = \frac{1}{6}\)`

---
## Discrete Random Variables

A discrete random variable has a sample space that is finite or countably infinite. When we refer to discrete random variables, the event itself can be numeric (the die shows 6) or not (the playing card is red), the random variable can still be discrete. 

e.g. Let X be the random variable that represents the number of heads in a single coin flip.

`\(x \in \{0, 1\}\)` where 0 indicates the outcome was tails and 1 indicates heads. Since the sample space is finite, X is a discrete random variable. 

---
## Discrete Random Variables

More examples

Let `\(X\)` be the number of heads in 5 coin flips. `\(\Omega_x = \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}\)`. The sample space is finite.

Let `\(X\)` be the proportion of correct responses on a test with 100 questions. `\(\Omega_x = \{0.00,0.01,0.02,...,0.98, 0.99, 1.00\}\)`. The sample space is finite. Note that the elements of the sample space is not integers.

Let `\(X\)` be the number of times you roll a die until you get a 6. `\(\Omega_x = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,...\}\)` The sample space is countably infinite.

## Expected Value

You are playing an amazing game where you always win. Host of the game makes you draw a banknote from a bag that has exactly four banknotes, `$1`, `$5`, `$10`, and `$50`. What is the expected value of earning in this game?

## Expected Value

You are playing an amazing game where you always win. Host of the game makes you draw a banknote from a bag that has exactly four banknotes, `$1`, `$5`, `$10`, and `$50`. What is the expected value of earning in this game?

Before learning probability: 

`\(\frac{1+5+10+50}{4} = 16.5\)`

After learning probability: 
`\(1\cdot \frac{1}{4}+ 5\cdot \frac{1}{4} +10\cdot \frac{1}{4} + 50\cdot \frac{1}{4} = 16.5\)`
---
## Expected Value

You are playing an amazing game where you always win. Host of the game makes you draw a banknote from a bag that has exactly five, `$1`, `$5`, `$10`, and 2 of `$50`. What is the expected value of earning in this game?

You are playing an amazing game where you always win. Host of the game makes you draw a banknote from a bag that has exactly five, `$1`, `$5`, `$10`, and 2 of `$50`. What is the expected value of earning in this game?

Before learning probability: 

`\(\frac{1+5+10+50+50}{5} = 23.2\)`

After learning probability: 
`\(1\cdot \frac{1}{5}+ 5\cdot \frac{1}{5} +10\cdot \frac{1}{5} + 50\cdot \frac{2}{5} = 23.2\)`

## Expected Value

You are playing an amazing game where you always win. Host of the game makes you draw a banknote from a bag that has exactly eight banknotes, two of each `$1`, `$5`, `$10`, and `$50`. What is the expected value of earning in this game?

## Expected Value

You are playing an amazing game where you always win. Host of the game makes you draw a banknote from a bag that has exactly four banknotes, `$2`, `$10`, `$20`, and `$100`. The amounts on the banknotes are exactly the double of what we have seen in the first scenario. What is the expected value of earning in this game?

After learning probability: 
`\(2\cdot \frac{1}{4}+ 10\cdot \frac{1}{4} +20\cdot \frac{1}{4} + 100\cdot \frac{1}{4}\)` or even better
`\(2\times[1\cdot \frac{1}{4}+ 5\cdot \frac{1}{4} +10\cdot \frac{1}{4} + 50\cdot \frac{1}{4}] = 2\times[16.5]\)`

---
## Expected Value of Discrete Random Variables
Expectation of random variable `\(X\)` with a pmf of `\(p(x)\)` is  
`\(E[X] = \displaystyle \sum_{x} x p(x) = \mu\)`

The expect value of linear combination of random variables `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` and fixed numbers `\(a\)` and `\(b\)` is 

`\(E[aX+bY] = aE[X] + bE[Y]\)`

---
## Variance of Discrete Random Variables

`\(Var(X) = E[(X-\mu)^2] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2\)`

Can you explain variance in words?

`\(Var(aX+bY) = a^2Var(x)+b^2Var(Y)\)`

## Descriptives Notation

| Description        	| Population Parameter 	| Sample Statistic 	|
|--------------------	|----------------------	|------------------	|
| Mean               	|         `\(\mu\)`       	|     `\(\bar{x}\)`    	|
| Variance           	|      `\(\sigma^2\)`      	|       `\(s^2\)`      	|
| Standard Deviation 	|       `\(\sigma\)`       	|        `\(s\)`       	|

## Mean and Variance with  R

For observed data we have already seen the summarize function which can be used to calculate mean, variance, and standard deviation.


```r
titanic_train %&gt;% 
  summarize(mean(Fare), sd(Fare), 
            var(Fare))
```

```
##   mean(Fare) sd(Fare) var(Fare)
## 1   32.20421 49.69343  2469.437
```

We will learn about how we can calculate `\(\mu\)` and `\(\sigma^2\)` for a given probability function.

## R as a calculator


```r
3 + 5
```

```
## [1] 8
```

Note that output is a vector with a length of 1. R is one indexed. 
---

## Object Assignment in R


```r
x &lt;- 13
x
```

```
## [1] 13
```
---

## Object Assignment in R


```r
y &lt;- c(21, 8)
y
```

```
## [1] 21  8
```

Note the [1] in the output the index number for 21
---

## Object Assignment in R


```r
test &lt;- c("yes", "no", "no", "no")
test
```

```
## [1] "yes" "no"  "no"  "no"
```

---

## Object Assignment in R

Why is it the `&lt;-` operator and not `=`?

Read more about it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1741820/what-are-the-differences-between-and-assignment-operators-in-r) after class.

## Unfair Die

An unfair die has been created with the following properties:


```r
x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
f_x &lt;- c(1/10, 1/10, 1/10, 2/10, 
         2/10, 3/10)
```

Is `f_x` a probability distribution? How do you know?

---
## Expected Value by hand

How would you calculate `\(E(X)\)` if you were calculating by hand? You do not need to calculate it but think about the process.
---
## Expected Value in R


```r
mu &lt;- sum(x*f_x)
mu
```

```
## [1] 4.2
```
---

## Variance by hand

How would you calculate `\(Var(X)\)` if you were calculating by hand? You do not need to calculate it but think about the process.
---
## Variance in R


```r
sigma2 &lt;- sum((x-mu)^2*f_x)
sigma2 
```

```
## [1] 2.76
```
---

## Standard Deviation in R


```r
sigma &lt;- sqrt(sigma2)
sigma
```

```
## [1] 1.661325
```
