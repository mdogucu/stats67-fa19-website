## Sampling (True or False)


An airline company wants an opinion on their service thus leaves a survey in the pockets of passenger seats. Some passengers respond to this survey. This is a random sample.

A cell phone factory wants to do quality control of their products to ensure that their customers do not get malfunctioning products. They randomly select 3% of the phones that they produce and manually check if there are any problems or not. All the cell phones in the world make up the population and the cell phones that this factory produces make up the sample.

## The Original Article

[Sex Bias in Graduate Admissions: Data from Berkeley](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b704/3d57d399bd28b2d3e84fb9d342a307472458.pdf)

## Design an Experiment

On the course syllabus it says:

<blockquote>
You will not be graded solely on attendance. Research suggests that attendance is a better predictor of grades than many other measures such as SAT scores, study habits, and study skills (Cred√©, Roch & Kieszczynka, 2010). Even though that is not a causal claim (we will learn more on this), If you would like to be successful in this class, you should attend ALL lectures and discussion sessions.
</blockquote>

This conclusion was not based on an experiment thus we cannot say attendance will directly lead to higher grades. Design an experiment to measure whether class attendance increases grades. Think about what data you would collect from the participants. How would your data frame look like? Which of these variable(s) would be response, which would be explanatory? Which of them will be categorical, numerical discrete, or continuous?
