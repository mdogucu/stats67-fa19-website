            <h1>Assessment</h1>
            Assessments theoretically serve a purpose of measuring how much you have learned (i.e. how much you have achieved
            of the course goals). I would recommend you to first focus on your learning, then grades will follow.
            I really hope you can focus on your own learning while enjoying the process.
            <h2>Attendance</h2>
            You will not be graded solely on attendance.
            Research suggests that attendance is a better predictor of grades than many other measures such
            as SAT scores, study habits, and study skills
            (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0034654310362998">Credé, Roch & Kieszczynka, 2010</a>).
            If you would like to be successful in this class (and your other classes), you should attend ALL lectures
            and discussion sessions. In addition, in almost all lectures and labs, you
            will have to submit an assignment. An important portion of your grade will based on these
            assignments. You will basically receive grade for coming to class and participating in group
            work.

            <h2>Homework Assignments</h2>
            <h2>Labs</h2>
            <h2>Learning Surveys</h2>
            <h2>Midterm</h2>
            Midterm is scheduled for.
            <h2>Final Exam</h2>
            <h2>Extra credit</h2>

            <h1>Objections to Grading </h1>

            If you believe that there is a grading mistake in any of your assignments,
            send an email to your grader (read below about <a href="#email">writing emails</a>).
            Your email should include 1) your answer 2) why you think you think it has been graded wrong.


            <h1>Grading Scheme </h1>

            Grades will <b>not</b> be curved and will <b>not</b> be rounded. Please do not email me about any of these.
            Understandably some you may be concerned about your grade.


            <h1>Academic Integrity</h1>
            You cannot share distribute solutions online or offline or in any media.
            <h1>Copyright</h1>

            <h1>Diversity and Inclusion</h1>
            We all (including myself) are continuously learning about diverse perspectives. In this course, if you
            encounter anything said (intentionally or unintentionally) that
            made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
            If your learning is impacted by your background, or any life
            event going outside of class, feel free to talk to me.
            Even if you choose not to share details, I would be happy to direct
            you to the right resources on campus.

            <h2>Addressing People in Academia</h2>
            <br>
          I was a first-generation student and  was quite confused about how to address professors and staff in college. I hope to draw some light on the topic.
          <br> <br>

            <ul>
              <li>If a person already informs you about how you should call them please respect that.</li>
              <li>Undergraduate degrees may be followed up by master's and doctoral degrees. If a person has a doctoral degree than they can be
                referred as <i>Dr.</i> folowed by their last name. Yes, just like medical doctors! It may be hard to guess whether someone has a doctoral degree. If you are, for instance, emailing
              someone for an opportunity, make sure to check their website before emailing them. They may list their degrees. The most common doctoral degree
            is abbreviated as <i>Ph.D.</i> but there are other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_doctoral_degrees_in_the_US">doctoral degrees</a>.
          Since the title <i>Dr.</i> is based on a degree, you can also use this title with anyone outside of academia if they have a doctoral degree.</li>
            <li>Even though many college professors have doctoral degrees, not all do. For instance, in the field of fine arts, master's degrees serve as the terminal degree.
            In other words, a fine arts professor may not have a doctorate but they have completed all the degree requirements to become a professor. For such academics
          who do not have a doctorate degree, you can refer to them as <i>Prof.</i> followed by their last name. You can also use the <i>Prof.</i> title with academics who
        have doctoral degrees. During my undergraduate and graduate studies Prof. was the title I used when addressing academics I did not know well.
        It does not make any assumptions about degrees and it is formal. </li>
        <li>The titles <i>Miss</i> and <i>Mrs.</i> are used for unmarried and married women respectively. In formal settings, since you are not aware of marital status
        of the woman you are referring to you can use <i>Ms.</i>. Use this title only with women who are not <i>Dr.</i> or  <i>Prof.</i>. The male title <i>Mr.</i>
      does not indicate marital status and can be used for men who are not <i>Dr.</i> or <i>Prof.</i>. Similarly the title <i>Mx.</i> does not indicate marital
    status and can be used for nonbinary people who are not <i>Dr.</i> or <i>Prof.</i>
    <li>Some people may prefer that you call them by their first name and some actually might find this rude. Unless you have been told to use first names,
    use one of the aforementioned titles. </li>

  </li>
