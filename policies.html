            <h1>Assessment</h1>
            Assessments theoretically serve a purpose of measuring how much you have learned (i.e. how much you have achieved
            of the course goals). I would recommend you to first focus on your learning, then grades will follow.
            I really hope you can focus on your own learning while enjoying the process.
            <h2>Attendance</h2>
            You will not be graded solely on attendance.
            Research suggests that attendance is a better predictor of grades than many other measures such
            as SAT scores, study habits, and study skills
            (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0034654310362998">Credé, Roch & Kieszczynka, 2010</a>).
            Even though that is not a causal claim (we will learn more on this), If you would like to be successful
            in this class, you should attend ALL lectures
            and discussion sessions. Most of what we do in person will be hands on and you will need to submit
            some of the work you complete in lectures and in discussion.
            An important portion of your grade will based on these
            assignments. You will basically receive points for coming to class and completing group
            work.
            <h2>Reading Questions </h2>

            Whenever there is an assigned reading, you should read before coming to class. Before class, you  will have
            to respond to questions online related to the reading. These questions will be on Canvas in multiple choice format.
            The main purpose of this assessment is to get you ready for hands on activities in class. For a given set of reading
            questions, if you score 60% or higher you will receive full credit. At the end of the quarter, your lowest
            reading question grade will be dropped but this rule only applies if you have completed all the reading questions
            throughout the quarter. Reading questions have to be completed individually. You may not seek help
            from others.

            <h2>In Class Activities </h2>

            We will be engaged in solving problems in class. You will work in groups to answer
            questions, discuss, and express your opinion. From time to time in class activities
            will be graded for completion.

            <h2>Homework Assignments</h2>

            Homework assignments are usually assigned on a weekly basis and they are due Fridays 5:00 pm.
            The format of the homework and how to submit (electronically or on paper) will be detailed in the
            homework instructions. Homework assignemtnts have to be completed individually. You may not seek help
            from others other than me or TAs.

            <h2>Labs</h2>
            You will be working on lab assignments during discussion sessions in groups.
            You will complete most lab assignments on RStudio Cloud. Labs are due to the end of discussion time.
            Further instructions on how to submit will be shared by your TAs during each discussion.
            If you are behind in the lab, seek help. If you are ahead provide help.


            <h2>Midterm</h2>
            There will be one midterm exam scheduled for Nov 6. The midterm will have both an in class
            and take-home part. For the take-home part you will have a week to complete. The in class part will be closed book but you will be given equations in the exam.
            You will need a scientific calculator. You will not be allowed to use a graphing calculator.

            <h2>Final Exam</h2>
            Final exams are scheduled for Wed, Dec 11 (Section C) 08:00 -10:00 am and Fri, Dec 13 (Section D) 08:00 -10:00 am
            The final will have both an in class  and take-home part. For the take-home part you will have a week to complete.
            The in class part will be closed book but you will be given equations in the exam. The final will be cumulative.
            You will need a scientific calculator. You will not be allowed to use a graphing calculator.

            <h2>Extra credit</h2>

            There are certain circumstances that you will be granted extra credit:
            <ul>
              <li>Participation in Statistics and Data Science Related Competitions
            <ul>
              <li>National Competitions</li>
              <li>Statewide Competitions</li>
              <li>Campus Competitions</li>
            </ul> </li>

            The number of points awarded based on competitions will be at the
            discretion of the instructor based on the alignment of course goals and  the goals
            of the competition, your ranking in the competition, and the amount of time put
            into competition.

            There are certain circumstances that may be granted extra credit at the discretion
            of the instructor:

            <ul>
              <li>Asking "good" questions on Piazza: instructors, TAs, and graders can mark
              your question as good. Note that extra credit is only possible for multiple
            good question status. You should not try to achieve this status. Your focus should
          be using Piazza effectively then extra points may follow. </li>

          <li>Posting "good" answers on Piazza: instructors, TAs, and graders can mark
          your answers as good. Note that extra credit is only possible for multiple
        good question status. You should not try to achieve this status. Your focus should
      be using Piazza effectively then extra points may follow</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>




            <h1>Grading Scheme </h1>

            Grades will <b>not</b> be curved and will <b>not</b> be rounded.
            Please do not email me about any of these.

            <h1>Communication Etiquette</h1>

            <h2>Addressing People in Academia</h2>
            <br>
            Addressing people in academia might be one of the most difficult
            part of being in an academic setting. Below I try to lighten the general
            information with a side note that each academic has their own preference.

            <br> <br>

            <ul>
              <li>If a person already informs you about how you should call them please respect that.</li>
              <li>Undergraduate degrees may be followed up by master's and doctoral degrees. If a person has a doctoral degree than they can be
                referred as <i>Dr.</i> folowed by their last name. Yes, just like medical doctors! It may be hard to guess whether someone has a doctoral degree. If you are, for instance, emailing
              someone for an opportunity, make sure to check their website before emailing them. They may list their degrees. The most common doctoral degree
            is abbreviated as <i>Ph.D.</i> but there are other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_doctoral_degrees_in_the_US">doctoral degrees</a>.
          Since the title <i>Dr.</i> is based on a degree, you can also use this title with anyone outside of academia if they have a doctoral degree.</li>
            <li>Even though many college professors have doctoral degrees, not all do. For instance, in the field of fine arts, master's degrees serve as the terminal degree.
            In other words, a fine arts professor may not have a doctorate but they have completed all the degree requirements to become a professor. For such academics
          who do not have a doctorate degree, you can refer to them as <i>Prof.</i> followed by their last name. You can also use the <i>Prof.</i> title with academics who
        have doctoral degrees. During my undergraduate and graduate studies Prof. was the title I used when addressing academics I did not know well.
        It does not make any assumptions about degrees and it is formal. </li>
        <li>The titles <i>Miss</i> and <i>Mrs.</i> are used for unmarried and married women respectively. In formal settings, since you are not aware of marital status
        of the woman you are referring to you can use <i>Ms.</i>. Use this title only with women who are not <i>Dr.</i> or  <i>Prof.</i>. The male title <i>Mr.</i>
      does not indicate marital status and can be used for men who are not <i>Dr.</i> or <i>Prof.</i>. Similarly the title <i>Mx.</i> does not indicate marital
    status and can be used for nonbinary people who are not <i>Dr.</i> or <i>Prof.</i>
    <li>Some people may prefer that you call them by their first name and some actually might find this rude. Unless you have been told to use first names,
    use one of the aforementioned titles. </li>

  </li>
            </ul>
